# Representations in Neural Networks

- See the [VDL page](https://restricted.vdl.afrl.af.mil/programs/atrpedia/dist_c/wiki/Representation_and_Phase_Transitions_in_Multi-Layer_Networks) for more information. 
- See also the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/djsaunde/rinns_python).

## Setting things up

Clone the GitHub repository in a directory of your choosing using `git clone https://github.com/djsaunde/rinns_python.git`. This will create a directory named `rinns_python` inside of your current directory. This statement should be run in a terminal in \*nix or Mac systems, or in a Git Bash shell on Windows.

Consult `requirements.txt` for the packages which the project code depends on. If you have `pip` installed (which you should), use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to recursively install the packages listed.
